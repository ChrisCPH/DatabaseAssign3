This represents a change from our 2015 GHG emissions tonnage figure.  This is due to inclusion of scope 3 emissions included in the Basic/Basic+ element of the inventory which GM commissioned which is now compliant with  the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventories (GPC), (WRI, C40 and ICLEI).  Previous submissions to CDP only included scope 1 and 2 emissions which drew directly from the national government DECC Local and Regional CO2 Emissions Estimates for 2005-2012 which used similar but not identical methodologies. This is part of a longer trend of decreasing emissions, punctuated with occasional increase years. Primary factors which determine the performance are the use of coal in any one year for grid electricity generation, and weather conditions during spring and autumn, where an extended heating season can occur if these are cold. A decline in total energy consumption is the most significant long term trend factor, due to the uptake of more energy efficient appliances, home adaptations, goods, services and transport;;5302028;;87773000000;;2013;UK ONS (using 1.56 USD/GBP) Figures provided is a GVA not GDP figure

As a result, overall natural gas use was up by eight percent in 2014 compared to 2013. Total greenhouse gas emissions from London have decreased compared to the peak in 2007. In 2014, greenhouse gas emissions were 19 percent lower than 2007. In fact, London's emissions in 2014 were six percent lower than the 1990 level used to benchmark emission reduction efforts. This is below the Kyoto Protocol objective (six percent below 1990) that Canada had previously committed to.							
							
Greenhouse gas emissions associated with electricity are significantly lower in 2014 (about 80 percent) than their peak in 2003. In 2014, only 0.1 percent of Ontario's electricity demand was generated by burning coal as these plants were shut down, and 10 percent was generated by burning natural gas. The rest of Ontario's electricity demand was met with emissions-free generation: 62 percent nuclear, 24 percent hydroelectric, 4 percent wind and other renewables.							
							
Conservation and peak demand reduction programs also contribute to lower emissions from power generation. Unfortunately, lower demand from the economic slow-down in manufacturing sector also contributes to lower emissions.";2771000;299000;;15400000000;CAD Canadian Dollar;2014;Conference Board of Canada, London Census Metropolitan Area data prorated by population and adjusted to 2007

18;Birmingham City Council;2016;5199.7;CO2;Decreased;Total CO2 emissions decreased between 2012 and 2013 by 3.2%. The reduction is consistent with the decrease in overall UK emissions from 2012 to 2013. The main drivers of the decrease in UK emissions in 2013 were a decrease in the use of coal and gas for electricity generation. This reflects the decrease in overall emissions for the UK during this period driven mainly by reductions in emissions from power stations, industrial combustion and passenger cars. The reduction from power stations is driven by change in the fuel mix used for electricity generation with a reduction in the amount of coal which is a carbon intensive fuel. The reduction in industrial combustion is largely driven by the closure or reduced activity of industrial plants, a large portion of which occurred during 2009 likely due to economic factors.;;;;84000000000;GBP Pound Sterling;2014;"""Global city GDP 2014"".

Road transportation has been the largest category of emissions since 1990. Total emissions in this sector increased between 1990 and 2008, however, they have been decreasing since 2008.

Between 2008 and 2014, building-related emissions declined as a result of lower overall building energy use, particularly for residential buildings, due to energy efficiency, more multi-family living, and especially by warmer weather that reduced winter heating needs.

136;City of Benicia;2016;688706;CO2 PFCs CH4 SF6 N2O NF3 HFCs;Increased;In 2010, community-wide emissions with large industrial emitters had increased from 2005 by 24% while community-wide emissions without large industrial emitters increased by 41%.  There was a 5.6% increase in emissions (2000-2005, with large emitters).   When the baseline inventory was completed, the team predicted that by 2010, emissions (w/ large industrial emitters) would increase 9% from 2005 to 4.6 million metric tons.  If large emitters were still included, then the increase between 2005 and 2010 was only a 24% increase, 15% more than what was originally predicted.  However, for 2010, it was decided to exclude large emitters.  This means that increases in all other sectors have a greater impact on total emissions, i.e. the increase in transportation emissions has a much greater impact on overall emissions levels.   The roughly 35% increase between 2005 and 2010 could be due to a number of things including changes in reporting protocols, e.g. permitting requirements changed or the non-recession years outweighed the recession years.  It could also be that Benicia was not as hard hit by the recession as other communities and therefore, emissions didn't decrease. Again, educated guesses have been made as to what caused the increase.    Please note that vehicle miles travelled (VMT) grew between 2000 and 2010 by 62%, while emissions increased 95%.  The % of total emissions from transportation is within the Bay Area average. The Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) calculates VMT using a proprietary software model. MTC inputs traffic counts, vehicle speeds, vehicle make and model, and fuel data into its software. In 2010, per the change in the modeling software, Benicia is now responsible for 50% of the trips that start elsewhere but end in Benicia and trips that start in Benicia but end elsewhere. This is calculated based on the number of people that exit or enter the highway in Benicia. Pass through VMT is not attributed to Benicia. Then, emissions are calculated by inputting VMT into the CACP software, which generates a GHG equivalent (MTCO2e). The increase in off road emissions is due to construction permit projections for buildings, which may have never been built. However, estimating off road emissions using construction permit data is the recommended calculation method per ICLEIâ€™s protocol and guidance.;;;;23000000;USD US Dollar;2014;Solano EDC http://www.solanocounty.com/depts/bos/working_to_create_jobs/economic_studies.asp

However, Pittsburgh did see reductions in the tonnage of solid waste sent to landfill and a reduction in vehicle miles traveled.

Community emissions per capita have also steadily dropped over time from 17.51 to 12.24 metric tons CO2e/person, a 30 % reduction, from 2002 to 2015. In addition, per capita emissions are 34% lower for Denton than for the U.S. average, in 2015 (World Bank). 							
									
The largest sources of community GHGs are from transportation (46%) and from residential (19%), commercial (10%), and industrial (18%) electricity consumption (together totaling 47% of Community GHGs). Emissions from the wastewater digester represent less than 1 % of total municipal GHGâ€™s.									
									
As with municipal operations, Community electricity related emissions have dropped by 26% from 2006, including a 3% drop from 2011 to 2015. This reduction is largely due to DME purchasing 40% wind electricity for all Denton customers beginning in 2009, and reducing purchases from coal produced electricity by 44% from 2011 to 2015.  It is important to note, that electricity related emissions from municipal operations dropped 11% from 2011 to 2015. In addition DME expanded itâ€™s free residential and small commercial energy audit program in 2008, and launched the GreenSense Energy Efficiency Rebate program for residential and small commercial customers in 2009.  The City created a Conservation Program Coordinator position in 2014 to enhance the audit and rebate program, and to develop increased public education about energy and water conservation.

However, Seattleâ€™s population grew by 13% in the same period resulting in a per person decline in emissions of 17%.							
Road transportation has been the largest category of emissions since 1990. Total emissions in this sector increased between 1990 and 2008, however, they have been decreasing since 2008. Advances in vehicle technology, plus a trend towards fewer vehicle miles travelled per person, have led both to decreased absolute emissions from road transportation (down 2% since 2008) and decreased emissions per person (down 13% during this period).									
Between 2008 and 2014, building-related emissions declined as a result of lower overall building energy use, particularly for residential buildings, due to energy efficiency, more multi-family living, and especially by warmer weather that reduced winter heating needs.									
									
This decline, though modest, is more impressive considering Seattleâ€™s population and economy have grown considerably since 1990.  On a per resident basis, Seattleâ€™s emissions declined  22% per since 1990 and 6% since 2008.									
									
A number of factors led to emissions decreases that counteracted the effect of population and economic growth, especially (as already noted) the decrease in carbon intensity of Seattle City Lightâ€™s electricity, more efficient cars and trucks, and building efficiency (including smaller dwellings) and fuel switching.  Increased efficiency of air travel also contributed to a decrease in GHG emissions.";;;The level of uncertainty associated with the data is addressed in the source notes in each section. http://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/OSE/ClimateDocs/2014GHG%20inventorySept2016.pdf;3,00827E+11;;2014;US Dept Commerce for Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue region

Among the factors found to be contributing to this reduction were:  1) greater energy efficiency and conservation in the residential and commercial sectors	 2) reduced number of industrial operations that are highly energy intensive	 3) conversion of Duke Energy's power generation plant fleet away from coal-fired units to natural gas fired units	 and 4) reduced total motor vehicle miles traveled in Greensboro.						
									
Additional factors that may have influenced this reduction include:  1) the national economic recession, during which many commercial and industrial sectors experienced significant contractions, many workers were unemployed, and many households downsized to smaller less energy consuming dwellings	 and 2) the Better Buildings for Greensboro program, which received $4.7M through American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.  The program provided:  a) free compact fluorescent lightbulbs, b) low-flow showerheads, c) Kill-A-Watt energy usage meters, d) home energy efficiency audits e) low-interest financing for purchase of energy-efficient appliances, f) energy bill rebates for home energy-efficiency upgrades, and g) funding for energy-efficiency upgrades to business and government buildings.";;;;;;;

A total reduction of approximately 6% in community-wide emissions was observed compared to the last verified inventory carried out during CY2012.  									
									
The Stationary Energy sector emissions decreased ~11% because natural gas and electricity consumption decreased across all sub-sectors.  									
									
The Transportation sector emissions decreased by ~3% predominately affected by significant decreases in the Waterborne Navigation and On-road Transporation subsectors.  This occurred despite an emissions increase in the Railways sub-sector emissions which was affected by a methodology change in the way Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) began collecting more specific power data and their use of a more conservative or higher emissions factor starting CY2013.									
									
Regarding the Waste sector, first, wastewater fugitive data collection was improved with better activity data.  This resulted in a more accurate picture of the contribution of fugitive wastewater emissions	 thus, cutting by nearly half what was originally reporting in 2012. Consequently, when we compare the Waste sector since last inventoried,  emissions actually increased 18% influenced by not only an increase in total wastewater treatment and discharge emissions, but also because of an 18% increase in solid waste disposed emissions.  The updated CY2013 waste characterization study was more detailed which allowed a closer look at organic waste.  As a result, the category ""Other Organic Waste"" is now included as organic	 previously categorized as inorganic.  Recategorization alone resulted in a 9% emissions increase.   The remaining 9% was a result of an increase in Wood+Textiles as well as Paper landfilled and thus emissions at ~5% and 4%, respectively.

295;City of Benicia;2017;688706;CO2 PFCs CH4 SF6 N2O HFCs;Increased;In 2010, community-wide emissions with large industrial emitters had increased from 2005 by 24% while community-wide emissions without large industrial emitters increased by 41%.  There was a 5.6% increase in emissions (2000-2005, with large emitters).   When the baseline inventory was completed, the team predicted that by 2010, emissions (w/ large industrial emitters) would increase 9% from 2005 to 4.6 million metric tons.  If large emitters were still included, then the increase between 2005 and 2010 was only a 24% increase, 15% more than what was originally predicted.  However, for 2010, it was decided to exclude large emitters.  This means that increases in all other sectors have a greater impact on total emissions, i.e. the increase in transportation emissions has a much greater impact on overall emissions levels.   The roughly 35% increase between 2005 and 2010 could be due to a number of things including changes in reporting protocols, e.g. permitting requirements changed or the non-recession years outweighed the recession years.  It could also be that Benicia was not as hard hit by the recession as other communities and therefore, emissions didn't decrease. Again, educated guesses have been made as to what caused the increase.    Please note that vehicle miles travelled (VMT) grew between 2000 and 2010 by 62%, while emissions increased 95%.  The % of total emissions from transportation is within the Bay Area average. The Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) calculates VMT using a proprietary software model. MTC inputs traffic counts, vehicle speeds, vehicle make and model, and fuel data into its software. In 2010, per the change in the modeling software, Benicia is now responsible for 50% of the trips that start elsewhere but end in Benicia and trips that start in Benicia but end elsewhere. This is calculated based on the number of people that exit or enter the highway in Benicia. Pass through VMT is not attributed to Benicia. Then, emissions are calculated by inputting VMT into the CACP software, which generates a GHG equivalent (MTCO2e). The increase in off road emissions is due to construction permit projections for buildings, which may have never been built. However, estimating off road emissions using construction permit data is the recommended calculation method per ICLEIâ€™s protocol and guidance.;;;A third party data anomaly in the 2010 inventory may result in significant revisions that show improved progress toward goals.;23000000;USD     US Dollar;2014;Solano EDC http://www.solanocounty.com/depts/bos/working_to_create_jobs/economic_studies.asp

Other items to note on year-over-year change include the following: Scope 1 emissions have decreased by about -20% compared to 2005. This is attributed Oregon's adoption of a Renewable Fuel Standard which sets minimums of 10% ethanol in gasoline and 5% biodiesel in diesel fuels sold in the state, as well the effect of energy efficiency adoption in the RCI sectors for natural gas as well as warmer winders in 2014 and 2015.

As of 2014 they are 16% lower than 1990 levels and expected to reach a 20% reduction in the 2015 GHG assessment (currently being finalised for publication later in 2017). This decline is due to decarbonisation of the national electricity grid, with a reduction in coal use and an increase in renewables share of the national energy mix. Gas usage has also decreased, due to energy efficiency improvements in homes and workplaces (including the roll-out of more efficient gas fired boilers) and a reduction in industrial activity within London. London's population continues to increase year on year and as of 2014 London's per capita emissions remain the UK's lowest at 4.4 tonnes.;19430000;18400000;;4,9155E+11;GBP     Pound Sterling;2014;London measures GVA rather than GDP.â€¢In 2015, Londonâ€™s total nominal GVA was over Â£378 billion, up 3.2 per cent on 2014.

Recalculating 2003 and 2008 inventories to compare to the 2013 inventory shows that emissions have decreased by about 4% since the 2008 inventory, but have still increased by 10% since 2003. Several exogenous factors reduced emissions - such as lower electricity emission factors due to a cleaner electric grid, and better fuel efficiency and lower tailpipe emission factors for cleaner vehicles. However, Pittsburgh did see reductions in the tonnage of solid waste sent to landfill and a reduction in vehicle miles traveled. The industrial sector used less electricity in 2013 than in 2003, and less natural gas in 2013 than in 2008. The commercial sector used less electricity in 2013 than in 2008, but used significantly more natural gas. The residential sector increased electricity use and substantially increased natural gas use. The increase in natural gas is likely due to improved data quality, but seems to also correlate to the rise of hydraulic fracturing in the region.

This represents a change from our GHG emissions tonnage figure reported to CDP in 2015 and a slight decrease in the first 2013 Global GHC protocol compliant Baseline Emissions inventory.  Repeating the reasons for the change - between emissions reported in 2015 submission and now (due to move to a compliant BEI process), this is due to inclusion of scope 3 emissions included in the Basic/Basic+ element of the inventory which GM commissioned which is now compliant with the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventories (GPC), (WRI, C40 and ICLEI).  Previous submissions to CDP only included scope 1 and 2 emissions which drew directly from the national government DECC Local and Regional CO2 Emissions Estimates for 2005-2012 which used similar but not identical methodologies. This is part of a longer trend of decreasing emissions, punctuated with occasional increase years. Primary factors which determine the performance are the use of coal in any one year for grid electricity generation, and weather conditions during spring and autumn, where an extended heating season can occur if these are cold. A decline in total energy consumption is the most significant long term trend factor, due to the uptake of more energy efficient appliances, home adaptations, goods, services and transport;10630853;6694801;;58000000000;GBP     Pound Sterling;2015;this is GVA (NOT GDP which is GVA+taxes-subsidies but this isn't available to us).  this is the Oxford Economics figure which has been deflated to 2013 prices and is the most used figure in policy documents.

The 2009 and 2015 GHG emissions balance, point to a decrease in the emissions (by 22% and 26% respectively) - which indicates that Porto is half way of his ambitious target to 2020 â€“ and these results are mainly  because of the decrease in the demand of fossil fuels (in mobility due to the Metro expansion) and â€œgreenerâ€ national grid electricity.;;;The level of confidence is high since the source of all data comes from oficial government institutes.

387;City of Gibraltar;2017;263352;;Decreased;"In comparison to the 2013 inventory , the emissions from Gibraltar are largely unchanged for scope 1. As in 2013, the scope 1 emissions are dominated by transport emissions, which have remained fairly constant across the period, demonstrating a 5kt increase. This change is largely due to increases in estimates in private marine fuel consumption after the use of more detailed, disaggregated fuel import data, as described in Section 4.2.1 of the inventory report. IPPU emissions remain a significant source of scope 1 emissions, and have also increased by 1kt in comparison to 2013. Emissions in this sector are estimated using population as a proxy, and therefore population growth within Gibraltar will have somewhat influenced the calculated increase in scope 1 emissions. Improved data has also been used to calculate IPPU emissions in Gibraltar	 for example, activity data regarding MDIs and N2O use has been provided by the Gibraltar Health Authority, rather than relying on scaling UK data. 								
When scope 2 emissions are considered, there is a 30kt decline in total emissions. A reduction in consumed gas oil used for electricity generation and an apparent improvement of the implied emission factor cause a decline in emissions from residential, and commercial, industrial, and government buildings and facilities. This is largely responsible for this trend.									
Waterborne navigation emissions have declined due to a methodology change within the calculation of emissions from shipping. As outlined in Section 4.2.3 of the inventory report, the definition of shipping attributable to Gibraltar on the basis of the recorded â€˜purpose of callâ€™ has undergone significant changes, and as a result, the emissions from scope 3 are largely reduced in 2015. 									
Because of a large number of method changes, an updated reporting approach using the now-finalised GPC, and data for the 2015 inventory method not being available for updating the 2013 inventory, it is not possible to confidently identify how much change in emissions is due to changing method versus changing activity.

397;City of Chicago;2017;30955862;;Decreased;"Chicago conducted a preliminary comparison using the existing 2010 and 2015 data to evaluate how community emissions have changed over the last five years. 									
									
Results of this preliminary analysis of 2010 and 2015 GHG emissions reveals Chicago continued to reduce total GHG emissions through 2015 in the stationary and waste sectors resulting in a greater than 7 percent reduction in GHG emissions over the last five years. During that time, Chicagoâ€™s population grew by approximately 1 percent while the regionâ€™s GRP grew by more than 12 percent. Growth coupled with reduction in total emissions resulted in a greater than 8 percent decrease in per capita emissions in the City.									
									
Between 2010 and 2015, the majority of MT CO2e reductions occurred in the stationary energy sector, followed by waste. When considering percent reductions, the waste sector experienced the greatest reduction (30 percent) which included a 35 percent emissions reduction in the solid waste disposal sub-sector. This reduction in the solid waste sector is likely driven by a decrease in the total amount of solid waste sent to landfills and an improvement in the solid waste treatment technologies at those landfills. The City expanded its residential curbside recycling pilot program to now serve over 400,000, or approximately 33 percent, of additional City houeholds.Because of the programâ€™s expansion the City experienced a significant increase in the number of tons collected for recycling, from 58,000 in 2010 to 97,000 in 2015.									
									
The stationary energy sector overall saw a 10 percent drop in emissions, including 11, 12 and 8 percent emissions reductions in the residential, commercial and institutional buildings and facilities, and manufacturing industries and construction sub-sectors, respectively. Stationary energy sector GHG emissions reductions are likely driven by a general trend in the building industry to improve energy efficiency of buildings as well as a regional shift in energy generation towards renewable energy sources. The City has also implemented the Energy Benchmarking Ordinance, Retrofit Chicago, and the Chicago Solar Express to encourage increasing energy efficiency and renewable energy generation and consumption within the city.";16951471;12967223;;5,63188E+11;;2014;Brookings Institution
